This project is in the WIP state and isn't recommended for public usage.
You can think of it as a small experiment with WebAssembly.
Unfortunately, FFmpeg.wasm in it's current state doesn't allow you to build performant web applications, which may change in the future of course.
By now this project is not developed at all
